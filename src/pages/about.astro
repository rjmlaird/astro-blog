    I'm Ryan Laird, a Chartered Marketer and the Director of <a href="https://greenorbit.space" target="_blank">Green Orbit Digital</a>, a Leicester-based agency specialising in sustainable marketing strategies for the space sector. With over a decade of experience in the space industry, I focus on integrating environmental responsibility into digital marketing efforts, helping organizations in the space sector thrive while embracing eco-conscious strategies.

    In addition to leading Green Orbit Digital, I serve as the Chair of the Startup Working Group at <a href="https://www.ukspace.org/" target="_blank">UKspace</a>, where I advocate for sustainable practices within the space industry. I also host <a href="https://www.sustainablespacepodcast.com/" target="_blank">The Sustainable Space Podcast</a>, discussing the intersection of space exploration and environmental responsibility.

    My work includes:

  <ul>
    <li>Developing sustainable marketing strategies tailored to the unique needs of the space industry.</li>
    <li>Supporting companies in reducing their environmental impact through innovative solutions.</li>
    <li>Collaborating with forward-thinking organizations to shape a greener future for space exploration.</li>
  </ul>
